The task is to fix the following C++ code errors with the given error messages and provide a description of the resolution of the error in JSON format.
The output JSON must be an array of the fixed codes, as well as the line numbers, and the resolutions.
Include the file names in the JSON output.
The input will be formatted in JSON.
The line and column numbers are also provided in the JSON object.
The source C++ code is provided and it is contained in the "code" label of the JSON object provided.

Example:
{"./Project1/Dog.cpp": [{"code": "    ptr2 = &val;\n\n    std::cout << \"Hello World!!!\" << std::endl\n    return 0;\n}\n","column": 47,"error": "expected ';' before 'return'","file": "./compilecode/Project1/hello_world.cpp","line": 11}]}

Response:
[{"fixed_code": "    ptr2 = &val;\n\n    std::cout << \"Hello World!!!\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n", "line": 11, "resolution": "The error was caused by a missing semicolon in line 11, column 47. As a result, a semicolon was added after the std::endl statement in order to solve the compiler error.", "file_name": "./Project1/Dog.cpp"}]
