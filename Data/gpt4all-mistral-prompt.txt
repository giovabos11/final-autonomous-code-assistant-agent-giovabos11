Assume FlowScript is a new programming language based on the Dot programming language. An example of FlowScript code to execute three jobs in order: "job1", "job2", and "job3", is the following :

digraph jobs {
    input -> job1 -> job2 -> job3 -> output
}

Now, write FlowScript code to execute three jobs in the following order: "compile", "parse_file", and "output_to_file".
Don't provide an explanation, only write the FlowScript. Don't include the word "flowscript" in the code.
